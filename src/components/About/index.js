                For the last five years, I've been helping the State of Utah come up with innovative technological solutions to move their workflow from a local mainframe environment to the cloud. My primary task was helping to recreate a new correspondence system through which agents could send correspondence to our customers.

                    I have recently graduated from the University of Utah Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This bootcamp reinforced my javascript, HTML5, and CSS skills I cultivated as a state employee, but I also learned the technologies associated with the MERN stack.
