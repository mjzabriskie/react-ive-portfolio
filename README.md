## Credits
I was able to pull inspiration for this portfolio from my previous portfolio made only with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featured [here](https://mjzabriskie.github.io/first-portfolio/), and from a [portfolio](https://github.com/Thenlie/portfolio) by [Thenlie](https://github.com/Thenlie), which was pointed out as an example to me by one of my mentors.
